### Description

The course adopts a global perspective, examining art from prehistory through to the 15th century.
It is not an exhaustive survey but focuses on major developments in art through case studies from past cultures and communities in diverse global regions. 
These case studies enable the exploration of examples from both non-Western and Western traditions. The course aims to enhance understanding and appreciation of visual art and art history methodologies, providing students with a foundational knowledge of art history and its pivotal moments.

### Prerequisite(s)/Corequisite: None


### Learning Outcomes

##### Course Objectives
This course provides a survey of global art from prehistory to the 15th century. By the end of the term, you will be able to:
- **Analyze & Identify**: Examine the formal qualities, historical contexts, and cultural meanings of key monuments and objects from across the globe.
- **Compare & Interpret**: Construct evidence-based arguments by comparing works from different cultures and interpreting them through primary and secondary sources.
- **Articulate & Communicate**: Present ideas clearly in both writing (employing art historical methods) and informed discussion.

##### Core Skills Emphasized
This course is designed to strengthen your:

- **Critical Thinking**: Integrating diverse views into rigorous, fact-based judgments.
- **Visual Literacy** : Decoding the complex and often contradictory meanings of visual expression.
- **Creative Analysis**: Solving interpretive problems when obvious solutions are not available.

### Art Historical Analysis
There are many approaches to art historical understanding but for our purposes we will focus on four:

- **Formal analysis** (color, shape, texture, scale, line, shadow, space, composition and other physical properties of the work itself)
- **Iconographic analysis** (story, theme or subject presented by the work including any symbolism or veiled meanings that would be legible to people part of the artist’s culture)
- **Sociohistorical analysis** (social, political, economic and cultural context in which the work is produced)
- **Aesthetic analysis** (sensuous and psychological impact that the work has on you and others)

    - **Analytical Readings**: These are scholarly texts that advance a specific argument. Your task is to engage with them critically by:
        - Identifying the author's thesis
        - Questioning their claims
        - Analyzing their evidence
        - Connecting their ideas to other course material

#### Accessing Perusall

All materials will be available through our course group on Perusall.

Detailed guidelines for each component will be provided in myClass.

#### 1) Participation & Attendance 
Active participation is crucial for this course. Your grade is based on the following components:
- **Consistent Engagement**: You are expected to keep your camera on during live Zoom sessions to foster a collaborative learning environment.
- **Camera Policy**: Turning your camera off will result in not receiving participation credit (10%) unless it is during a break or you have communicated with me in advance for accommodations.
- **Discussion Contribution**: Actively contribute to class discussions by asking questions, responding to prompts, and engaging with your peers' ideas.
- **In-Class Activities**: Complete all micro-activities, such as polls and short collaborative tasks, announced during the session.

:::danger[Attendance Policy]
Attendance for our live Zoom sessions is mandatory. More than two unexcused absences will require a meeting with me to discuss your standing in the course. 
Failure to address chronic absenteeism may result in failing the course.
::::

If you have high levels of social anxiety or find it challenging to read social cues in a groups discussion,
and find yourself unable but eager to participate please email me at KRafie@nwpolytech.ca: we can
discuss alternatives or how to manage anxiety around participation.

**Note on Recordings**:
Sessions will be recorded for educational purposes. By participating, you consent to being recorded. 
If you miss a session, please email me to receive the link of the missed session.

#### 2) Reading Annotations

Reading assignments will be completed on Perusall. Your grade will be based on the quality of your annotations, which will be evaluated according to the criteria. More details will be provided in future and on myClass.

#### 3) Artifacts

Artifacts are creative projects that allow you to engage with course materials beyond traditional writing. While rooted in research and critical thinking, they encourage artistic expression and alternative modes of understanding.

Please check myClass and course announcements for specific prompts and detailed guidelines for each assignment.

**Comparative Analysis**: This is a traditional essay assignment where you will compare two artworks from different cultures or time periods discussed in the course. The essay should demonstrate your ability to analyze formal qualities, historical context, and cultural significance (See [Art Historical Analysis](#art-historical-analysis)). The length may vary between 300-500 words. 

#### 5) Ancient World in Contemporary Visual Culture

This assignment asks you to trace the influence of ancient art on contemporary visual culture. You will find a modern work that draws from ancient themes, motifs, or techniques and analyze the connection in a final paper.

##### Part 1: Proposal (10%)

    **Length**: 150-200 words for the body (5%)  
    **Citations**: Two cited sources (5%)  

    **Task**: Identify a modern film, book, advertisement, artwork, or other media (including your own creative work). Briefly explain its connection to an ancient source or a theme from our course, providing evidence-based analysis.

##### Part 2: Final Paper (35%)

    Length: 1000-1250 words

    Task: Write a detailed analysis of your chosen contemporary work. Explore how it reinterprets, references, or draws inspiration from the ancient art or themes we have studied.
